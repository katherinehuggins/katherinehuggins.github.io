    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>
     Hello, I'm Katherine Huggins! I grew up in Sacramento, CA and moved to New York City when I was 16 years old to study ballet at the Joffrey School. I was on my school paper throughout high school and advanced to an editorial position, as well as taking over the Literary Art Magazine. I am currently double majoring in dance and journalism/design at The New School, and hope to have my two passions intersect. In my free time, I can be found doing yoga, cooking, and reading the news!
