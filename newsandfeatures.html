<p>Frigid temperatures swept across much of the Northern US and Canada beginning Monday, threatening frostbite and hypothermia to exposed populations.</p>
<p>
  The polar vortex is a constantly whirling weather system that typically hovers over the Earth’s poles. A low pressure system over Alaska and Greenland caused the vortex to spin out of alignment, leading to the bone-chilling temperatures over the past week.</p>
<p>
  Nationwide, 21 weather-related deaths have been reported, three of which occurred in New York state, according to The New York Times. Keeping warm through the low of two degrees (that felt closer to -17 degrees, due to wind chill) was a struggle for most, but disproportionately affected those without proper shelter or access to warm clothes. 
</p><p>
  Despite the cold, homeless couple Traveller and Belva have remained hopeful. And together they have managed to find methods of staying warm. 
</p><p>
  “We have this sleeping bag someone gave us about a week ago that kept us warm when it was seven below,” said Traveller.
</p>
Though the city has put in significant effort to help the homeless population, many, including Traveller and Belva, are left to fend for themselves in the cold harsh temperatures.
<p>
  “A lot of people walk by and basically judge every homeless person as the same, and do not tell the difference between those trying to get off the streets,” said Traveller. “People just pass us by. It’s really sad that you can see something like that and just pass by.”
</p><p>
  When asked about the best way to help, Traveller emphasized that money is going to help the most.</p>
<p>
  “We really just need funding to get out of the cold,” said Traveller. “Recently we spent $160-$170 on a hotel room for three days. Or even if someone comes and says ‘hey come with me, I know a place.’”
</p><p>
  Many New Yorkers have the fortune of finding a good source of warmth during these extreme weather flairs, and some have just remained as if nothing has changed. 
</p><p>
  Union Square business owner, Michael Marino, remarked “my work is inside, we have indoor heating and my business will be fine.” 
</p><p>
  These extreme weather conditions caused by the polar vortex are going to affect everyone in the affected areas in one way or another but are going to have a bigger impact to those who cannot find warmth and shelter during these frigid times.
